# Pomodoro Productivity Timer Widget

A simple productivity widget that implements the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) to help you stay on task and get more work done.


The app uses a web worker to make sure the timer persists even if it isn't the active tab.   Additionally, alarm will play at the end of your current work or break session to remind you that it is time to move to the next work or break session.
